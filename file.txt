Method 1: Using a Personal Access Token

Go to your GitHub account and generate a personal access token with the repo scope. You can do this by going to Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens.
Create a new Azure DevOps pipeline or edit an existing one.
In the pipeline settings, go to Variables and add a new variable named GITHUB_TOKEN with the value of your personal access token.
In your YAML file, add the following code to authenticate with GitHub:

steps:
  - task: GitHubAuth@0
    displayName: 'GitHub Authentication'
    inputs:
      token: $(GITHUB_TOKEN)

Use the checkout task to access your private GitHub repository:

steps:
  - task: Checkout@2
    displayName: 'Checkout'
    inputs:
      repository: 'your-github-username/your-private-repo'
      authentication: $(GitHubAuth)
